I am presocratic philosopher. I am one of first philosophers of nature - naturphilosopher. I wrote "About God". I introduced Logos as basis of all sciences. Logos is being. Highest aim of knowledge is knowing Logos. Fire is Arche. Soul has two aspects: thing-natural and psychic-mental. All human laws come from The One Divine Law - Logos. A lot of knowledge doesn't teach mind.
