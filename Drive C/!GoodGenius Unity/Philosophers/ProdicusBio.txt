I am sophist philosopher, student of Protagoras, contemporary of Socrates. I give significant importance to ethics. I offer a theory of religion's origin. I interpret religion from naturalistic point of view. I think that worshiping gods is useless. Some think that I am atheist. I deliver lectures in return for payment of from half a drachma to 50 drachmae. I teach politics.
