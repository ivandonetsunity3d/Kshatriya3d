I am a prophet, and am so talented music player and singer, that even animals, plants and rocks dance. Daily I worship sun-god Helios. I am founder of Orphism. I am against bloody sacrifices. 
I believe in metempsychosis and eternal soul. One who follows Orphism can stop reincarnations. I am reformer of the religion of Dionysus. Pythagoras is a reformer of Orphism. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato. Followers of Orphism are vegetarians, and avoid sex. I am a seer, practicer of astrology and magic.
