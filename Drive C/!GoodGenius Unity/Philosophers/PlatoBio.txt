I am the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. I laid the very foundations of Western philosophy and science. I am great thinker, one of founders of European philosophy. I believe in world of Eidoses - ideas. I am founder of idealism. In my dialogue Phaedo I give four arguments in favor for soul's eternity.
